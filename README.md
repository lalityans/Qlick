# Qlick - Data-Driven Innovations in Supply Chain Management

# Description - Supply chain management is a critical aspect of modern businesses, 
involving thecoordination of various processes and activities to ensure the efficient flow of goods
and services from suppliers to customers. However, traditional supply chain
management approaches often rely on manual processes, historical data, and intuition,
leading to inefficiencies, delays, and suboptimal decision-making. The business problem
addressed in this project is the need for data-driven innovations that can streamline
supply chain operations, enhance decision-making, and improve overall supply chain
performance.
